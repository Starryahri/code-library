# Ahria's Personal Code Library

A code library that is under constant revision.
Mainly for Unity, but other languages are also included.
Would like to expand it out to Unreal, but that might be unfeasable.

Feel free to look around:

Movement
Dialogue
Controllers/Managers
UI/UX
Settings
Inventory
Health
Save/Load System
